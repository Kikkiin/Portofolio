# Portofolio
My portofolio 1

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a selection of projects I've developed during my studies at Noroff. These projects so far include an interactive website for a children's science museum, an online movie retail site, and a blog about Oslo.

## Projects

### Community Science Museum

This project is a website for the Community Science Museum, targeting children but also catering to their parents and young adults. The aim is to inspire and engage children in scientific topics through a fun and interactive online experience. The website features:

### Square Eyes

An online platform for renting and purchasing movies. This site offers everything from the latest blockbuster movies to lesser-known quality films and series. Developed to provide users with an easy and engaging way to find and enjoy their next movie adventure.

### Oslo Blog

An engaging and informative blog dedicated to everything about Oslo, from hidden gems to well-known attractions. This blog is perfect for both visitors and residents looking to explore the city in new ways.

## Built With
